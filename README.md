# Spectrum Point Calculation
This is a solution for calculating points customers receive depending on how much they spend.
A customer receives 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for every dollar spent over $50 in each transaction. (e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1x$50 = 90 points).

It also provides report on reward points earned for each customer per month and total.
